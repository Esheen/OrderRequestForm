Web Presence Assignment
Take a business function (inventory ordering, payroll processing, customer service, security issue tracking, to do list, etc.) and make the following Web page:

A company logo must be on the Web page, floated right, and taking up no more than 25% of the width
An external cascading style sheet must be used for all formatting, with at least 5 elements, classes, and/or IDs being used
The background and foreground colors must be changed.  (It must be readable!)
Accept at least 15 data elements on one (and only one) Web page form
On the form, the labels and fields are aligned using an HTML table
Use one and only one submit button tied to the form
Use at least one radio button (no defaults are to be set)
Use at least one drop down list box (have the top entry be blank or indicate that some choice needs to be made)
Use at least three text boxes, at least one of which is numeric (no defaults are to be set)
Use at least one check box
Using JavaScript, validate every field except check boxes so that, upon clicking the submit button:
Text boxes are to be checked to make sure that something is filled in
Text boxes with numeric fields have numbers in them
The user must select something (besides the top row) in the drop down list box
Radio buttons must not default to a checked value, and the user must select one of the radio button choices
When the user clicks Submit, if the data is correct, the form must go to www.duq.edu.  If the data is not correct, a SINGLE textbox must pop up describing all of the errors.
The HTML page must be validated via the doctype tag to HTML 5.0 standards using the W3C validator (https://validator.w3.org/)
The CSS must be validated to CSS 3.0 standards using the Jigsaw validator (http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
Stickers must be placed on the pages upone successful validation.  (Make sure the addition of the stickers don't invalidate the page!)
